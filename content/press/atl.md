summary: His playing was transcendental. To borrow a phrase from C.S. Lewis, to listen
  to Goosby was to be surprised by joy. ... Goosby's tone walked a perfect balance
  between silky smooth and gutturally abrasive, conveying the piece’s tumultuous cavalcade
  of emotions with the expert precision normally associated with folk legends rather
  than real people. Whether delivering searing long notes or intricate speed runs,
  each note of Goosby’s performance stood alone as an individual work of art.
