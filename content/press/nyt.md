summary: Where many young musicians might make their mark with a war horse concerto
  by Mendelssohn, Bruch or Beethoven, Goosby instead assembled a sweeping recital
  program of works by Black composers — including a premiere written by the bassist
  Xavier Dubois Foley and first recordings of Florence Price discoveries — as well
  as by Dvorak and Gershwin, two white composers whose music on the album reveals
  an indebtedness to their Black peers.
