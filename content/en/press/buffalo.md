summary: 'Young American violinist Randall Goosby’s clear tone and limpid phrasing
  proved to be ideal in the BPO’s performance of Bologne’s Violin Concerto in G major,
  Op.8, no.2. Although Bologne’s music might not match Mozart’s genius, it still has
  much to offer, especially in the languid second movement, with Goosby’s unaffected,
  lyrical playing. A dramatic cadenza bridged the second to the third movement, a
  “rondeau”, in which the repeated main theme was separated by pauses between the
  intervening development. Goosby is a talent from whom we should hear much more. '
