summary: "[Randall Goosby's] sense of impish playfulness was evident throughout the concerto, all good-humoured and at peace with the world. ... [H]is playing was never short on contrasts. The central Adagio offered a solo line of finely spun silk and the closing sequence intensified the essential serenity, like being mesmerised by the gentle flickering of a candle in the darkness of night. ... [I]n the final Rondo where Mozart suddenly plunges into a short pavane-like episode in G minor ... the overlapping of the inner parts played pizzicato demonstrated perfect adroitness. In Goosbyâ€™s encore, the Louisiana Blues Strut by Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, the sunny smiles and sense of fun were out in full force."
