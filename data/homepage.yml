      position: ""
      content: "His playing was transcendental. To borrow a phrase from C.S. Lewis, to listen to Goosby was to be surprised by joy. ... Goosby's tone walked a perfect balance between silky smooth and gutturally abrasive, conveying the piece’s tumultuous cavalcade of emotions with the expert precision normally associated with folk legends rather than real people. Whether delivering searing long notes or intricate speed runs, each note of Goosby’s performance stood alone as an individual work of art."
