    “제게 있어 음악은 다른 사람들을 고양시키는 방법입니다.” 랜들 구스비가 직접 이야기한 이 문장은 탁월한 아티스트가 되기 위해 전념해 온 그의 삶을 완벽하게 대변해 주고 있다.</p>
    <p class="lead">2020년 24세의 나이로 데카 레코드와 전속계약을 맺은 미국의 바이올리니스트 랜들 구스비는 섬세하면서도 강렬한 음악성의 소유자로 클래식을 보다 포용력 있고 접근하기 쉬운 음악으로 만들기 위해 노력하는 한편, 잘 알려지지 않은 작곡가들의 음악을 부단히 소개하면서 평단의 찬사를 한 몸에 받고 있다.</p>'

      content: "His playing was transcendental. To borrow a phrase from C.S. Lewis, to listen to Goosby was to be surprised by joy. ... Goosby's tone walked a perfect balance between silky smooth and gutturally abrasive, conveying the piece’s tumultuous cavalcade of emotions with the expert precision normally associated with folk legends rather than real people. Whether delivering searing long notes or intricate speed runs, each note of Goosby’s performance stood alone as an individual work of art."
